# What is a Tile Map?

Remember we studied about Unity's component system, well, TileMap The Tilemap component is one such system which stores and handles Tile Assets for creating 2D levels. 

If you haven't gone through the basics in Unity, here is a refresher course for you:

[Getting Started with Unity](https://academy.outscal.com/getting-started-with-unity)

It transfers the required information from the Tiles placed on it to other related components such as the Tilemap Renderer and the Tilemap Collider 2D.

You will need to download the 2D TileMap Editor via the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Packages.html), as it is not included in the default Unity installation.

When you create a Tilemap, the Grid component is automatically parented to the Tilemap and acts as a guide when you lay out Tiles onto the Tilemap.

To create, modify, and pick the Tiles for painting onto a Tilemap, use the Tile Palette (menu: Window > 2D > Tile Palette) and its tools.
