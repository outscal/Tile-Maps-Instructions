# Introduction

Hi there, Clanmate! This course will help you to build new features to your game, for any platformer you will always need tilesets that correspond to your environment in the scene, especially for 2D games.

This is where tilemaps come in to the picture.

The below game called Super Mario is a perfect example of such a game and the ground and other floating platforms are what can be set up to use TileMaps.

To get access to the ready-made project, please use the below git repository link to clone to your local device and open with Unity.

[Github Project Repository](https://github.com/outscal/Tile-Maps.git)

The repo has 2 branches - Problem-Statement and Solution-Statement, the former being the one with all the readymade projects and the latter had got the solution.

You should try building the solution yourself first, then look at the Solution-Statement for an alternative solution.

So, let's get started.
